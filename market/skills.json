Discover repos by topic, track API changes, clone and analyze codebases, search for implementation patterns, and compare different approaches across your collection.\nBONUS FEATURES for code reviews: Smart book detection (Clean Code, Refactoring, Design Patterns, etc.) uses Claude's training data instead of reading PDFs (saves 40K+ tokens per book). PDF summarization available for research papers and niche documents (80-90% token savings on re-reads).\nUse this skill when the user wants to: add/remove repos, search GitHub, explore codebases, track API changes, compare implementations, or review code using technical book principles.\nTriggers: \"add repo\", \"find repos for\", \"search my KB\", \"how does X handle Y\", \"compare repos\", \"explore this repo\", \"track changes\", \"what's new in\", \"review code using Clean Code\".\n",
