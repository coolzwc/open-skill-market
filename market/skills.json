It spawns a coordinated team of researcher agents across multiple rounds, with the lead triaging findings and creating targeted follow-up tasks. Scales from Focused (2 researchers, 1-2 rounds) to Comprehensive (4 researchers, 3-4 rounds with cross-verification). Do NOT use for simple lookups, debugging, or questions answerable with 1-2 searches.\n",
